Linux Kernel for OrangePI H3 boards
===================================

About
-----

The repository contains Linux kernel sources (3.4.39) adapted for OrangePI H3 boards, gcc toolchain, adapted rootfs and building scripts.

Building
--------

Kernel config files and the files specific to OPI board are placed in **build** directory.

The included build script *build_linux_kernel.sh* can be used to build the kernel<br />
`./build_linux_kernel.sh [clean | all | 2 | plus] [clean]`

**clean** as 1st parameter cleans the kernel tree and build directories<br />
**clean** as 2nd parameter cleans the kernel tree before build<br />
**all** builds the uImage for OPI-2 & OPI-PLUS<br />
**2** builds the uImage for OPI-2<br />
**plus** builds the uImage for OPI-PLUS<br />

After the build the resulting kernel files (uImage and kernel modules) are placed into **build** directory.

To build **script.bin** for all OPI boards and resolutions run:<br />
`./build_scripts [clean]`<br />
**clean** as 1st parameter cleans the scripts and logs<br />

After the build the *script.bin* are placed into **build** directory.

To **configure kernel** run:<br />
`./config_linux_kernel.sh`
